\\nthe need for a single set of requirements. although the meeting with keith, \\non wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \\nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \\nconsuming.  throughout the meeting on wednesday, keith alluded to the \\ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \\nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \\narrange the position screen to their liking (much like excel). what needs to \\nhappen on monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \\nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. this does not exclude \\nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \\nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \\nrequirements. also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \\nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \\nthe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \\nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \\nproject.\\n\\ni have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \\ngood. i believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \\nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\\n\\nrichard  \\n---------------------- forwarded by richard burchfield/hou/ect on 10/06/2000 \\n08:34 am ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nallan severude\\n10/05/2000 06:03 pm\\nto: richard burchfield/hou/ect@ect\\ncc: peggy alix/hou/ect@ect, russ severson/hou/ect@ect, scott \\nmills/hou/ect@ect, kenny ha/hou/ect@ect \\nsubject: consolidated positions: issues &amp;

to do list\\n\\nphillip,\\n below is the issues &amp; to do list as we go forward with documenting the \\nrequirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport \\ntrade capture. what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan's list; \\nthe need for a single set of requirements. although the meeting with keith, \\non wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \\nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \\nconsuming.  throughout the meeting on wednesday, keith alluded to the \\ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \\nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \\narrange the position screen to their liking (much like excel). what needs to \\nhappen on monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \\nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. this does not exclude \\nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \\nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \\nrequirements. also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \\nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \\nthe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \\nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \\nproject.\\n\\ni have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \\ngood. i believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \\nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\\n\\nrichard  \\n---------------------- forwarded by richard burchfield/hou/ect on 10/06/2000 \\n08:34 am ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nallan severude\\n10/05/2000 06:03 pm\\nto: richard burchfield/hou/ect@ect\\ncc: peggy alix/hou/ect@ect, russ severson/hou/ect@ect, scott \\nmills/hou/ect@ect, kenny ha/hou/ect@ect \\nsubject: consolidated positions: issues &amp; to do list\\n\\n\\nfrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \\npositions, i think we still have the following issues:\\nwe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  we've had \\nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \\ntraders.  we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \\nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\\nwe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \\nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\\n\\nthings left to do:\\ni think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \\nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \\nproject.  it'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\\ngo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \\nproject and which fall out of scope.\\nfor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \\nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\\ndefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \\ndrill downs.\\nuse the above to formulate a project plan.\\n\\nthings requested thus far (no particular order):\\ninclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal \\nticker.\\ncustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \\nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\\nnew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \\ntransport, swaps, options, ...\\naddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \\nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\\nability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \\nshown directly above monthly positions.  each grouped column in the top grid \\nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\\nability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \\nappropriate positions to show for each:\\ngas daily for monthly index,\\nphysical gas for nymex,\\nphysical gas for inside ferc,\\nphysical gas for mid market.\\nability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of \\nusing official valuations.\\nposition and p&amp;l aggregation across all gas desks.\\nability to include the gas price book into tds:\\ninclusion of spread options in our systems.  ability to handle volatility \\nskew and correlations.\\nability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \\napproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \\ngamma grid.\\nvaluation of gas daily options.\\na new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  tbd.\\ninclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\\nability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \\nmanager.\\nability to view change deal p&amp;l in the tds deal ticker.  show new deal terms, \\nprior deal terms, and net p&amp;l affect of the change.\\neliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker.\\nposition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \\nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\\nbenchmark positions in tds.\\ndeployment of tds in canada. currency and volume uom conversions. implicit \\nand explicit position break out issues.\\n\\n-- allan.\\n\\nps: colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \\ntransport.  hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \\npoint.</td>\n",

partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nland ownership &amp; loans\\nthe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nall loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nuse of initial investment\\nthe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\ncreekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nearly land costs\\nthe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nequity at improvement loan\\nonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nthe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nphasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nconstruction loans\\nthere are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nspec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\ndisbursements\\ndisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner\\nwill contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the\\nfee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nthese fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nfinally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nreporting\\nwe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nwhat did you have in mind?  i would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nbookkeeping\\ni am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  please expand.\\n\\ninvestor input\\nwe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  as always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume\\nkeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\ncreekside proceedures\\ncb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  in the extremely tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  for the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\npre-selected professionals, subs and vendors\\nyes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\ni know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  call\\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\ngeorge richards\\npresident, creekside builders, llc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n - winmail.dat</td>\n",

fun out of the trip.  especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nas far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nmy suggestion for where to go is austin.  play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  flying somewhere takes too much time.   \n",

not\\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  i will\\nknow more on this question later today.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\ngeorge w. richards\\npresident, creekside builders,

i am concerned there may have been an attempt to \\nmanipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index.  it appears that a single \\nbuyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above \\nmarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas.  at the time of these trades, \\noffers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \\nbypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \\ncalculation.  additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated \\nfinancial swaps for san juan.\\n\\n we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \\nseptember 25 to september 27.  these are the complete list of trades from \\nenron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \\nfirms (amerex, apb, and prebon).  please see the attached spreadsheet for a \\ntrade by trade list and a summary.  we have also included a summary of gas \\ndaily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread \\nrelationships.  the two key points from this data are as follows:\\n\\n 1.  the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \\nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \\n\\n 2.  the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & \\nnorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and \\n       october gas daily.  it doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that \\nare dramatically different.\\n\\n\\n i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  hopefully, the \\ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \\ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \\noutliers.  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \\nestablishing a reasonable index.  it is enron's belief that the trades at \\n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \\ncalculation of index.\\n\\n it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to \\nconduct our physical and financial business.  please contact me \\nanytime i can assist you towards this goal.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\nphillip allen   \n",

an attempt to \\nmanipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index.  a single buyer entered the \\nmarketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \\n($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  at the \\ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \\ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \\nreport into the index calculation.  additionally, these trades are out of \\nline with the associated financial swaps for san juan.\\n\\n we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \\nseptember 25 to september 27.  these are the complete list of trades from \\nenron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \\nfirms (amerex, apb, and prebon).  please see the attached spreadsheet for a \\ntrade by trade list and a summary.  we have also included a summary of gas \\ndaily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread \\nrelationships.  the two key points from this data are as follows:\\n\\n 1.  the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \\nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \\n\\n 2.  the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & \\nnorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and \\n       october gas daily.  it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that \\nare dramatically different.\\n\\n\\n i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  hopefully, the \\ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \\ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \\noutliers.  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \\nestablishing a reasonable index.  it is enron's belief that the trades at \\n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \\ncalculation of index.\\n\\n it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \\nconduct our physical and financial business.  please contact me \\nanytime i can assist you towards this goal.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\nphillip allen   \n",

pm\\nplease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\\nto: \"phillip allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\\ncc: \"larry lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"claudia l. crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nsubject: investment structure\\n\\n\\nstructure:\\ntypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc)\\ngeneral partner.  the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nland ownership & loans\\nthe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nall loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nuse of initial investment\\nthe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\ncreekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nearly land costs\\nthe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nequity at improvement loan\\nonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nthe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nphasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nconstruction loans\\nthere are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nspec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\ndisbursements\\ndisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner\\nwill contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the\\nfee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nthese fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nfinally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nreporting\\nwe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nwhat did you have in mind?  i would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nbookkeeping\\ni am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  please expand.\\n\\ninvestor input\\nwe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  as always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume\\nkeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\ncreekside proceedures\\ncb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  in the extremely tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  for the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\npre-selected professionals, subs and vendors\\nyes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\ni know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  call\\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\ngeorge
